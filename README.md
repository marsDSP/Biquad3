# Biquad3
Simple 3band biquadratic filter, with FFT and SIMD optimization. Comprehensive study of the 
bilinear transform, FFT, Euler etc. Also includes highly documented code with optimizations and comparisons of what I 
used to do vs what I do now. This pretty much entirely a practice repository for me, mastering filter design and various 
optimization techniques hopefully. Feel free to steal whatever you find here.
